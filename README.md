Spring Boot is an auto-configured microservice-based web framework that provides built-in features for security and database access.

With Spring boot, we can quickly create stand-alone applications without having to make too many configuration changes (as we will see later). MongoDB is the most popular NoSQL database because of the ease with which data can be stored and retrieved. Combining Spring Boot and MongoDB results in applications that are fast, secure, reliable, and require minimum development time.

This tutorial demonstrates how we can integrate Spring Boot with MongoDB using the Spring Data MongoDB API.
